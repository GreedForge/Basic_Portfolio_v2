               I graduated as with a BA in Physics in 2012 from Grinnell College. Since then I have spent most of my time working for the Texas State Board of Public Accountancy as an Investigator. My job moslty consisted of reviewing adertising practices of financial industry businesses and determining weather they were using certain protected terms. I would then send them a letter requesting voluntary compliance. As of this Monday I left my job at the Accountancy Board and have been attending a coding bootcamp at UT. I hope to use UT's coding bootcamp to apply for tech industry positions as a web developer with the eventual goal of working as a product manager or in management in general.
